## Overview 

My Reads is a React application, which help its users to keep track of the book in their collection. <br />
The App provides 3 shelves to arrange the books - Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read.
Users can move the books from one shelf to another and also can add new books to any of the shelves from the search. <br/>
The Search functionality uses Udacity's BookAPI which holds a limited number of books and also responds to only a limited number of search phrases.<br />
